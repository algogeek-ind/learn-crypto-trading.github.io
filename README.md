  > "Support and resistance are strong supply and demand ''lines in the sand'' that are specific prices on a certain financial instrument that are known from historical price movement to be a price that a large amount of buyers and sellers, institutional and private, will use to buy or sell a stock, index, Crypto-currency and other financial instruments."


* [@wolfofpoloniex - Bare Basics of trading Cryptocurrency](https://steemit.com/cryptocurrency/@wolfofpoloniex/bare-basics-of-trading-cryptocurrency)
  "I have found that BASIC TA (Triangles, patterns, fib levels) is almost always more powerful than the more advanced stuff like Harmonics (Gartley / Butterfly patterns). I believe this is due to the fact that the large portion of new day-traders learn the basics and it works for them so they just stick to it. TA is supposed to be about understanding the mass’ psychology behind the markets, but with a market that is, for the most part, ‘simple’… then keeping it simple will turn out to be a lot more effective than throwing out advanced TA."

This article is primarily aimed at:\n\n— Those who have heard the term technical analysis but do not know what it entails\n\n— Those who are well aware of the practice but remain sceptical\n\nIt is at this point I should stress that by no means am I rehashing some orthodox doctrine on what technical analysis is and isn’t (if there were such a thing). These are my personal views and a way of thinking about technical analysis that has made me a better trader.\n\nMoreover, just to make my position clear: I am primarily a technical trader, therefore my implicit position is that technical analysis ‘works’ (to be defined later)."

  > "Here are 2 extremely simple, yet extremely effective price action signals which can be used to trade any financial instrument, with precise entry and exit levels for day trades or longer term swing trades.\n\nThe first is known as an inside bar formation which consists of a large ''mother'' candle, and a proceeding 2-5 price candles that all sit inside the range of this mother candle, showing us a sign of consolidation and indecision in the prices next move."

### More Patterns  [**^**](#contents)

* [ABCD Pattern Trading](http://www.profitf.com/articles/patterns/abcd-pattern-trading/)
  > The ABCD pattern (AB=CD) is one of the classic chart patterns which is repeated over and over again. The ABCD pattern shows perfect harmony between price and time and is also referred to as ‘measured moves’. It was developed by Scott Carney and Larry Pesavento after being originally discovered by H.M Gartley.

* [Elliott Wave Principle - Key to Market Behaviour Book Review](https://steemit.com/@twoblokestrading/elliott-wave-principle-key-to-market-behaviour-book-review)
  * "Elliott Wave Principle by Frost and Prechter is widely considered to be the most comprehensive overview of Elliott Wave Theory ever written. First published in 1978 and written by two men who understood Elliott’s ideas better than anyone, it has stood the test of time and continues to find new print runs and new fans.\n\nThis book is a must read for anyone who is truly interested in the way markets move on both short and long time frames. But it comes with a warning - this is one seriously dense book! At times it reads more like a mathematical proof; at times like an economic history textbook."


* [Trading Fibonacci retrace and expansion to pinpoint entries and exits](https://steemit.com/bitcoin/@cryptobroye/success-strategies-4-trading-fibonacci-retrace-and-expansion-to-pinpoint-entries-and-exits)
  >Fibonacci is a sequence found in us and our genes, our mentality, nature and our universe. Its is a universal, multidimensional language, that in my belief is used far beyond our personal human lifetimes and this world.\n\nFibonacci sequences in trading financial instruments is an extremely powerful thing. We can use 50% and 61.8% retraces of a move up or down as an entry into a position with a very tight stop loss, and we can then use a 121% Fibonacci expansion level as our price target as explained in the video below."


* [Harmonic Pattern GARTLEY](https://www.profitf.com/articles/forex-education/harmonic-pattern-gartley/)
  > "The harmonic patterns way of trading is an entirely different approach to trading the markets and is based on the discovery by H.M. Gartley whose findings were presented in his book in 1935 entitled “Profits in the stock market”. The book was a lengthy one at that and back in the days it sold for a premium. The most famous aspect of H.M Gartley’s book is the Gartley 222 Pattern, named after the page number where H. M. Gartley outlines the trading methodology using the Gartley pattern."


* [What is a Dead Cat Bounce? - Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deadcatbounce.asp)
  > "A dead cat bounce is a temporary recovery from a prolonged decline or a bear market that is followed by the continuation of the downtrend. A dead cat bounce is a small, short-lived recovery in the price of a declining security, such as a stock. Frequently, downtrends are interrupted by brief periods of recovery — or small rallies — where prices temporarily rise. The name \"dead cat bounce\" is based on the notion that even a dead cat will bounce if it falls far enough and fast enough."

  > "The Relative Strength Index is never an overbought/oversold indicator. If you did not learn Relative Strength Index from the original text, then it is very likely that you have been taught the wrong thing right from the beginning - that RSI is an overbought/oversold indicator. I want to tell you straight away that this is wrong."

* [@CryptoCred on RSI and Divergence](https://twitter.com/CryptoCred/status/1037772897241255936)
  > "Important point about RSI: \n\nAfter a big move/candle there will almost always be a regular divergence. \n\nDon’t use it to try to snipe the bottom or top.\n\nDivergences work better when they form during a discernible trend, NOT after a bazooka candle like yesterday."

  > "As mentioned before, you only need one type of indicator. So, if you’re using both the RSI and the Stochastic RSI, you’re wasting your time. They both are leading(1) momentum(2) indicators that look at the same thing — is a crypto oversold or overbought? Therefore, you just need one. Study the both of them or another momentum indicator that makes the same determination and choose one.\n\nUnderstanding How and When to Use the Indicator"

* [Divergence and Hidden Divergence](http://www.chart-formations.com/indicators/divergence.aspx)
  > "Although divergence is not an indicator in that it is not mathematical construct, it is often said to be a leading indicator, hence its inclusion in this section.\n\nDivergence refers to the difference in movement between an oscillating indicator, such as MACD, CCI, RSI, Stochastic, etc., and the price action of the underlying financial instrument."


### Risk Management [**^**](#contents)

* [Risk Management for Trading](https://medium.com/@Cryptilicious/risk-management-for-trading-8608d813872d)
  > "Trading crypto-currency is a gold rush. While selling shovels is traditionally the best way to wealth in such a scenario, doing wise investments is essential once you have some money. I consider trading an entertaining and challenging pastime. Maybe the most important aspect of trading is risk management. While resources like BabyPips provide great learning material, their section on risk management is confusing. I believe, the biggest issue is that they approach the topics in the wrong order, so here is a better introduction to risk management for traders (crypto or forex or otherwise)."

* [One of the Most Important Concepts in Trading](https://cryptowest.com/2018/08/24/one-important-concepts-trading/)
  > "When trading you need some way to manage your risk. One of the most effective and notable strategies is the R method. When talking to new traders I like to give the example of a poker player. You start out small and overtime you end up building your bankroll/trading capital to a sizable amount. What makes the R multiple so helpful is it allows you to size your position relative to risk. This allows you to understand the risks required when trading and risk what you are comfortable with.  I am shocked everyday on twitter by the amount of people unaware of these risk management concepts."

### Indicators [**^**](#contents)

It identifies support and resistance levels, gauges momentum, identifies the direction of trends and provides trading signals.\n\nWith one single glance, traders can identify the trends in securities and examine further signals within that trend. While this indicator might seem complicated, it is actually a very simple indicator that is highly useful for all traders."


* [@cryptocred on EMA](https://twitter.com/CryptoCred/status/1012453593876660224?s=19)
  > "Here's a harsh truth:\n\nOver ~90% of Twitter traders would be better off trading a super basic EMA crossover strategy than whatever made-up wholly discretionary 'plan' they're following right now.\n\nIf you're going to trade manually, make sure it's worth your time and money."


* [Bollinger Bands](https://www.bollingerbands.com/bollinger-bands)
  > "Bollinger Bands are a technical analysis tool, specifically they are a type of trading band or envelope. Trading bands and envelopes serve the same purpose, they provide relative definitions of high and low that can be used to create rigorous trading approaches, in pattern recognition, and for much more. Bands are usually thought of as employing a measure of central tendency as a base such as a moving average, whereas envelopes encompass the price structure without a clearly defined central focus, perhaps by reference to highs and lows, or via cyclic analysis. We'll use the term trading bands to refer to any set of curves that market technicians use to define high or low on a relative basis."

  > "Almost a decade ago the founder of Cryptol0gy, R1S1N6, was in a position where most people are today. All he had was a hundred dollars on his father’s Forex account, and all he could dream of was turning that into a luxury car and a Rolex watch.

The most common applications of moving averages are to identify the trend direction and to determine support and resistance levels. While moving averages are useful enough on their own, they also form the basis for other technical indicators such as the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)."

  >"To ensure the cryptocurrency movement moves along the right path, we who participate in it must teach ourselves to be skeptical not only of sensationalized statements, but also of skeptical statements themselves. We must be aware of how easily we are manipulated when our fear systems are triggered, and adjust our investing behavior accordingly. Those who have the time should actively try to bring clarity to the discussion when they have reliable information or insight."

* [The Anatomy of a Pump & Dump Group](https://bitfalls.com/2018/01/12/anatomy-pump-dump-group/)
  > "Members of the core layer agree on a coin and inform the outer rim about it. Even inside the core layer there are often several levels – for example, those who paid entry (averaging 1 – 10 BTC) generally get their information 5-6 seconds before others. That's plenty of time to buy the coin at a lower price. Others join in afterwards and only 10-30 seconds later do the outer rims find out which coin was picked and go into hardcore shopping."

Market prices have always been manipulated by the government's visible hands through influencing laws and regulation. Insiders control markets and manipulate them up or down for profit. Manipulation is everywhere, undeniable and unavoidable. It happens on a very large scale throughout every single financial market out there, stock, bonds, commodities, currencies and so forth.

That would suggest you own 1% of the company. And that would be correct, as of right now.\n\nWhat is often not calculated in these sorts of numbers is future dilution, particularly dilution that is visible if you look closely. The most common form of future dilution that is visible are outstanding options and warrants to issue stock that have not been exercised."

  > "We apply time series analysis to investigate the market cycles of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) as well as bitcoin and Ether. Our results show that shocks to ICO volumes are persistent and that shocks in bitcoin and Ether prices have a substantial and positive effect on these volumes – with the effect of bitcoin shocks being of shorter duration than that of Ether shocks. Moreover, higher ICO volumes cause lower bitcoin and Ether prices. Finally, bitcoin shocks positively influence Ether but not the other way round. Our study has implications for financial practice, in particular for cryptocurrency investors and entrepreneurial firms conducting ICOs. June 2018"

  > "We estimate the profitability of global index-level trading strategies formed on daily weather across 49 countries. We use ex ante weather information combined with the statistical relationship between daily weather and country index returns to predict index returns on each day. We then form a long-short hedge strategy and a long-only strategy, and find that both strategies generate substantially out-of-sample gross profits. The long-only strategy produces more consistent annualized profits of up to 20.5%, as opposed to a mean world index return of 3.75% during 1993-2012. These findings help solidify the claim that weather exerts economically important impact on mood, and investors can trade profitably on daily weather."

Of course having a nice backtesting code allows to build really good strategies with risk management, money management and consider different scenarios, but if you’re researching just signals obtained from different data sources (even it’s just historical prices) with use of machine learning you need something simpler to understand if these signals to go long or short are really useful.

Outperforming and underperforming is relative to the crypto universe. Therefore if the average crypto coin is up 1000% the dark green coins, in aggregate, would be attempting to beat that.
